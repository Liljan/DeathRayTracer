# DeathRayTracer
Based on "Raytracing in a Weekend" at first.

## Todo
There are many tasks to be done.

### Housekeeping 🧹
- [x] Set-up Project
- [ ] Add unit testing (Google Test for example)
- [ ] Folder structure
- [ ] CMake file for Windows and MacOS (with shell scripts and bat-files for easy installs)

### File I/O 💾
- [x] PPM file export (image)
- [ ] BPM file export (image)
- [ ] Scene file loader
- [ ] Scene file structure
- [ ] Material file structure
- [ ] JSON file import (scene files)
- [ ] Model/texture loader
- [ ] Obj file reader (vertex & uv-data)

### Raytracing 🌞
- [ ] Export a test image
- [ ] Ray class
- [ ] Anti-alias
- [ ] Gamma correction

### Materials 🍷
- [ ] Diffuse lambertian material
- [ ] Metal material
- [ ] Transparent material

### Geometry 📐
- [ ] Sphere structure
- [ ] Triangle structure
- [ ] Plane structure
- [ ] Ray vs. Sphere intersection
- [ ] Ray vs. Tri intersection
- [ ] Ray vs. Plane intersection
- [ ] Abstract "Shape" structure
- [ ] Octree for faster collision testing
- [ ] Translatable, rotable and scalable meshes
- [ ] Other implicit meshes (donuts etc.) 

### Camera 📸
- [ ] FOV
- [ ] Movable
- [ ] Rotatable

### Optimization 💪
- [ ] OpenMP Multi-threading
- [ ] Polygon rendering order algorithm
- [ ] Octree for fast collision detection
